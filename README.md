## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stemmed from recognizing the inefficiencies in the original fleet management systems. Manual vehicle request processes were prone to delays, errors, and a lack of accountability, which ultimately detracted from the primary mission of helping youth in need. We wanted to create a platform that not only streamlined operations but also empowered staff and managers to focus on what matters most—providing support and services to their communities.

## What it does
Our platform is an all-in-one fleet management solution designed to simplify vehicle requests, approvals, and returns. Staff can browse available vehicles, submit requests, and amend rejections with ease. Fleet managers can review driving histories, approve or deny requests via email, and track vehicle usage. Facility managers can oversee vehicle assignments, validate returns through in-person inspections, and log vehicle conditions efficiently. By centralizing data and automating workflows, FleetSync ensures seamless communication and accountability across all levels.

## How we built it
We developed the project using a combination of modern web development tools and techniques. Our front-end was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. On the back-end, we used systems and Power Automate to handle workflows such as request submissions, email automation, and data logging.

## Challenges we ran into
As a newly formed team, one of our biggest challenges was building establishing efficient workflows in a short amount of time. Many of us were unfamiliar with fleet management systems, so we had to quickly learn the intricacies of approval processes, vehicle validations, and data tracking. Additionally, designing a system that caters to users with varying technical expertise required careful thought and testing. The tight timeline added pressure, pushing us to work swiftly while maintaining quality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a functioning prototype that addresses real-world challenges in fleet management. Our team successfully collaborated under tight deadlines, combining creativity and technical skill to bring this project to life. More importantly, we’re proud of designing a system that can make a meaningful impact on underserved communities, helping organizations save time and allocate resources more effectively.

## What we learned
This project taught us the importance of adaptability, communication, and teamwork, especially when tackling unfamiliar systems in a limited timeframe. We learned how to prioritize tasks, focus on user needs, and integrate technical solutions that address real-world problems. It also reinforced the value of staying mission-driven, as the purpose of supporting underserved communities motivated us to push through challenges.

## What's next for Future CEOs Fleet Project?
Looking ahead, we plan to enhance our website by adding features such as real-time vehicle tracking, predictive maintenance alerts, and advanced analytics for vehicle usage and fuel efficiency. We aim to optimize the system for scalability, allowing it to serve larger organizations. Additionally, we hope to gather feedback from users and refine the platform further to better meet their needs. Ultimately, we envision this as a transformative tool that empowers organizations to serve their communities more effectively.
